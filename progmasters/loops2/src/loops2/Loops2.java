        //        Task
        //We use the integers a, b, and n to create the following series:
        //
        //     (a + 20 x b), (a + 20 x b + 21 x b), ... ,(a + 20 x b + 21 x b + ... + 2n-1 x b)
        //
        //You are given q queries in the form of a, b, and n. For each query, print the series 
        //corresponding to the given a, b, and n values as a single line of n space-separated integers.
        //
        //Input Format
        //The first line contains an integer, q, denoting the number of queries. Each line i 
        //of the q subsequent lines contains three space-separated integers describing the respective ai, bi, and ni values for that query.
        //
        //Constraints
        //
        //0 <= q <= 500
        //0 <= a, b <= 50
        //a <= n <= 15
        //
        //Output Format
        //For each query, print the corresponding series on a new line. Each series must be printed in order as a single line of n space-separated integers.
        //
        //
        //Hint
        //Make sure not to print any extra spaces at the ends of the lines!
